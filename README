fincore
=======
A utility for determining whether a file is in the kernel's buffer cache.

This simple program iterates over a list of files and calls mmap() and then
mincore() for each disk block of a file.  It reports whether the blocks are in
the kernel's page buffer cache.

This is a fully C implementation of David Plonka's fincore work, available at
