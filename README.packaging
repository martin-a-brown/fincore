If you retrieved this package from a version repository, you may notice that
there's no ./configure file.  That's by design.  No sense in versioning this,
it seems.  The following should get you on your way:

  $ autoreconf --install
  $ ./configure && make  # -- as usual

If you wish to package, consider also that you can build a package straight
from this tarball:

  $ rpmbuild -ta fincore-0.XX.tar.bz2
